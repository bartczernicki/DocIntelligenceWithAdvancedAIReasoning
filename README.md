# Doc Intelligence With Advanced AI Reasoning

## Objective and Risk Analysis Pipeline
OpenAIâ€™s o1 model model series, are cutting-edge reasoning engines. Unlike standard language models, they're optimized to handle complex, multi-step challenges that go beyond simple text generation, offering enhanced capabilities for problem-solving and logical reasoning. Additionally, these models include built-in mechanisms ideal for risk analysis, helping to ensure more reliable and safe outputs in critical decision-making tasks.

The o1 model series achieves this by optimizing the reasoning approach. Similarly to management consulting companies, these models break a problem down into smaller parts and "think" over a detailed approach. To come up with an optimized plan, these models can spend quite a bit of time achieving both an optimal approach and optimal outcome. Because these models can take many seconds (sometimes up to 35+ seconds) to return a reasoning answer, it does not make them ideal for real-time Generative AI scenarios like chat interfaces. However, these specific o1 models are ideal for business process workflows & pipelines where the better approach and outcome are sufficiently important.  

This repository includes a C# Console application that will orchestrate the following Risk Analysis Pipeline below:
